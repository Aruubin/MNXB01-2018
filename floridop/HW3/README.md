# Description of the problem

I've discovered that on the internet somebody wrote an API (Advanced
Programming Interface) to download a set of fortunes, small messages with some 
sort of wisdom. You can see it at

> <http://fortunecookieapi.herokuapp.com/>

I'd like to have a bash script that downloads these fortune messages
and shows me a random one every time I run the command.

The command should be called  
> `fortuneteller.sh`

To help debugging, the command should accept 
an input parameter `--printinfo`:

> `./fortuneteller.sh --printinfo`

That shows all intermediate files generated in the process.

# Homework 3

My suggestions how to implement the script are in the 
`fortuneteller.sh.skeleton` file. 
Each of them is worth a certain number of points for the Homework. 
You must follow them to get the points, as they introduce you to
various useful bash commands and some mind-bending reasoning that is
quite common in bash.

I also placed a copy of the output I'd like to see from the script in
the

>  `./result`

folder, in a file called

> `output.log`

Good luck!
